## Comparing costs of health care in the US vs other countries tha have a universal healthcare system.

Healthcare costs in the US are astronomical. many people can't see though how other countries have it for less always talking about increased taxes and neglecting that they esentially pay a tax for healthcare through insurance companies which are highly ineffecient. So the purpose of this blog is to show how much more we spend then other high GDP countries for our healthcare. All universal healthcare systems outside the US relly on 2 factors strict price regulations for health provided costs and some government level of health coverage which we will go into later.

We will cover three types of healthcare systems.  Government mandate, Two Tier, and Single Payer.  One might ask what these all means
* Government mandate is a system much like what the Afordable care act tried to be. It basicaly means that all people are required to get healh insurance through a provider that can be subsidised by the government for low income individuals.  In all countries except the US along side teh mandate is a government body that is established to analise prices of various treetments and to set standards for how treetments are coded and paid out
* Two Tier is a system where the governemnt through taxes covers basic and catostrophic care.  othe types of care are covered by a suplemental insurance coverage.  This is sort of akin to medicare part B
* Single Payer is a system where all healthcare payements are made through the government as the insurer and the premiums are collected through a tax.

As we can see all other countries except Switzerland pay between two thrids to one half of what the US pays on a per capita baisis.  They all have a significantly higher health care ranking then the US though. As can be seen in fig1  most of the highest ranked sytems either have a two tier health system or a single payer system.

As mentioned previously from fig1 Switzerland is the only country that pays almost as much as the US for health care per individual.
